You will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, to speak the language of your data, to understand what they are telling you.

## At a glance
* In Class Instruction: 2 Hours
  * In Class code along Dataset: Housing Prices Dataset

## Why complete this?
The foundations of statistical thinking took decades upon decades to build, but they can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up to speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

## Project
Iowa Dataset

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset will help you determine aspects which influence price of a property other than sq.ft. area and locality.
